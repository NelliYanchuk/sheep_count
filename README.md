# 🐑 Counting Sheeps 🐑

Welcome to **Counting Sheeps**, the ultimate sheep-counting experience! 🐺❌🐑✅

## 🧑‍💻 Live Demo

You can view the live version of the project through **GitHub Pages**: [Dragonball Web Project](https://nelliYanchuk.github.io/sheep_count)

## 🌟 The Challenge:
Ever wondered how many sheep you’ve got before the wolves sneak in? Now you can find out! The goal of this project is to count the sheep (represented by `true` values) while dodging the wolves (`false` values).

## 💡 How It Works:
- **True** = Sheep 🐑
- **False** = Wolf 🐺

Just pass a list of booleans, and the function will tell you how many sheep survived.

## 🔬 Test Cases:
- **Input 1**: [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, true]
  **Output**: "There are 17 sheep in total"

- **Input 2**: [false, false, false]  
  **Output**: "UPS!!! Wolves ate the Sheeps!"
